    Coming home with young men, after balls, “at all hours.”
  Its villas don’t mind; they say, “Go it, young swells,
    We’ve been young, too!” But Ebenezer Street glowers.

  Chapel deacons live here, with side whiskers and pompous wives,
    Who play hymns on Sundays, and deeply deplore sinful acts.
  They’re convinced that their neighbours lead scandalous private lives;
    —That you and I ought to be shot, “if one knew all the facts.”</p><p>All down Jamaica Road there are small bow windows
    Jutting out neighbourly heads in the street,
  And in each sits, framed, a quiet old woman.
    These watch the couples who pass or meet,

  And some have borne sons, now ageing men;
    And most have seen death in their narrow house;
  Heard wedding bells for their grandchildren;
    Seen boys seek the bar for a last carouse;</p><p>My man fell in, when he was drunk;
    They’d thrown him out o’ the “King’s Head.”
  From Wapping stairs he fell, and sunk.
    He was my man; he’s dead.

  On the cold slab, a sight to see,
    They’ve laid him out—poor handsome chap—
  In Rotherhithe’s new mortuary.
    His head should dent my lap,

  But I mayn’t warm him where he lies,
    Because I have no ring to show—
  Yet I’ve his bruises on my eyes;
    And bore his child a month ago.</p><p>In Mare Street, Hackney, Sunday nights,
    My Jim he’d search for souls to save:
  Beneath one of them showman’s lights
    He’d stand up white and brave.

  “And who’s for Jesus now?” he’d call,
    “And who’s for Love that’s strong?
  Repent, believe: there’s Heaven for all
    That turns and flees from wrong....”

  I wish no harm to my poor Jim,
    But God strike Lizzie dead!
  ’Twas cruel of her to lead the hymn,
    With me laid ill, in bed.

  They’re gone—last month—to Leytonstone;
    Jim has a pulpit there;
  So I’m left hungering here alone,
    While _she_ joins him in pray’r.
