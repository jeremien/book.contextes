        <h1 id="pref">Prefatory Note</h1>
        <p>It is not the purpose of this book to try to establish a claim for printing that it is an art. It is hoped
            that it may show that the principles of art may be applied to printing, and that such application may lead
            to improvement in some essentials of printing.</p>
        <p>Thanks are due to several experts in printing who have read the proofs, and have given wise and acceptable
            counsel.</p>
        <p>I desire to acknowledge that aid has been freely sought from books upon art, and that in some instances forms
            of expression have been adopted from them. No originality is claimed for the allusions to art, nor for art
            terms and formulas employed.</p>

            <span class="smcap">Because</span> it is difficult to perfectly transfer a thought from one mind to another
            it is essential that the
            principal medium through which such transference is accomplished may be as perfect as it is possible to make
            it.</p>

        <h1>Art in Printing</h1>

        <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is this vital difference between other objects of art and printing: That our
            association with them is
            purely voluntary, and that printing forces itself upon us at all times and in every relation of life. It is
            impossible
            for a person of intelligence to remove himself from the influence of printing. It confronts him at every
            turn, and
            in every relation of life it plays an important and insistent part.</p>

        <p>Such examples of art as a painting or a piece of statuary exert a certain influence upon a restricted number
            of persons;
            and it is at all times optional with all persons whether they submit themselves to the influence of such art
            objects.
            We are able to evade the influence of other forms of art, but we are not able to ward off printing. To it we
            must
            submit. It is constantly before our eyes; it is forever exerting its power upon our consciousness. It is
            quite possible
            that we may not at present be able to refer any quality of mind, or any degree of
            cultivation, directly to printing, in any form it may have been presented to us; but it is easily
            conceivable that printing
            has a certain influence upon our esthetic life which has been so constant and so habitual as to have escaped
            definite
            recognition.

        <h1>Pictorial Composition</h1>

        <p>
            <span class="smcap">While</span> too much science is often deadly to art, the true basis of pictorial
            composition is rigidly scientific,
            and all of the principles governing it are of use and importance to the printer, especially in planning
            displayed
            work and in title pages.</p>

        <p>Composition is that quality which gives a picture coherence, "the mortar of the wall." It was not esteemed of
            importance
            by the old masters, and many of their works do not show that they knew or cared for that which distinguishes
            a picture
            from a map, a group photograph, or a scientific diagram. It is the absence of composition, balance, unity,
            that makes
            ordinary photographs something other than true works of art. It is not primarily truth of representation
            that is
            necessary in a work of art, but truth of idealization; and that quality is beyond the conscious reach of the
            camera's
            lens. It is a redeeming and a justifying element added by the imagination of the artist. There may be a
            picture, by a photographer or by a painter, having all the requisite component parts to make it a work of
            art; there
            may be, for example, a woman, an axe, a road, a mountain, trees; but these thrown together upon a canvas do
            not make
            a work of art unless they are properly composed, even if they are arranged in an order satisfying to the
            realist,
            and each faultlessly executed. It is not the same thing to paint and to make pictures; to print and to
            execute artistic
            printing.</p>
